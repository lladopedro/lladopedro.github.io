<p>I am Pedro Llad√≥, a PhD student at Aalto Acoustics Lab in the Spatial Sound and Psychoacoustics group. Currently working on binaural auditory models for extended reality applications evaluation supervised, continuously learning about psychoacoustics and experimenting with spatial audio.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Mallorca, moved to Barcelona where I studied telecommunications engineering at UPC (especialization in audiovisual systems) and later the Sound and Music Computing master at Music Technology Group. After some work experience in different areas of acoustics and audio, I got the great opportunity to move to Helsinki, willing to keep learning a lot, and not only career-related issues.</p>
