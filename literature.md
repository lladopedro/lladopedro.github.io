List and summary of highly cited and/or relevant psychoacoustics bibliography

# Spatial Hearing
#### Blauert, 1997 (Book) - Spatial hearing: the psychophysics of human sound localization
This book offers a good analysis of the fundamentals of human spatial hearing. It offers a high-quality material as introductory text and reference book.
Main topics are experimental procedures for sound localisation experiments, evaluation of monaural and binaural cues, evaluation of multiple sound sources...
Easy to read and to understand, I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn the basics of spatial hearing.
### Binaural cues
#### Jeffres(1959) - Delay-line based
This is a test to see how it works...
