List of highly cited and/or relevant psychoacoustics literature that may be useful to learn the fundamentals.
This list will be hopefully increasing while I find some topics to write about and some time to do it. If you think that I should include something else here, reach me on social media (see below) or e-mail (lladopedro@gmail.com). 

# Spatial Hearing
